# ðŸ›Œ Sleep Apnea Detection App  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The **Sleep Apnea Detection App** is an Android application designed to monitor sleep health by detecting potential sleep apnea symptoms. It integrates **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to connect with an **ESP32-based embedded system** that collects **SpO2 and BPM** data. The app provides **real-time monitoring, authentication, and local storage** for a seamless user experience.
